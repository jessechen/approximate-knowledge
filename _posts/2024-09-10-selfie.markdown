While the noun *selfie* is first attested in 2002 on an Australian website, becoming common Australian slang in that decade, it was not widely used internationally until 2012. The first usage of the #Selfie tag on instagram is recorded in January 2011. By 2013, it was selected as the OED's word of the year. Part of this was likely that taking a selfie was cumbersome until front-facing cameras on phones became commonplace. They were first introduced on the iPhone 4 in mid-2010.

I was surprised to learn that "selfie stick" was not popularized until 2014; the two terms are strongly associated in my head.
