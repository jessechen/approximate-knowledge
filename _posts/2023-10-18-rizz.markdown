The quality *rizz* was popularized by streamer Kai Cenat on Twitch and later YouTube in the summer of 2021. To us olds, Kai is probably most well-known for accidentally starting a riot in Union Square, NYC earlier this August. It's thought to be a phonetic clipping of *charisma*. The word's usage took off on TikTok in mid-2022, giving rise to incredible explainers like this one from Defector: [https://defector.com/livvy-rizzing-up-baby-gronk-explained](https://defector.com/livvy-rizzing-up-baby-gronk-explained)
