The term *guy* referring to a (typically male) generic person goes back to 1847. This was a generalization from an its earlier usage meaning "bizarrely dressed person" (1836), which was in turn generalized from its earlier usage meaning "effigy of Guy Fawkes to be burned" (1806).

Guy Fawkes (1570-1606) has effigies that were regularly burned because he had hidden enough gunpowder to blow up the entire House of Lords and assassinate King James I on site before he was discovered on November 4, 1605. For the next four hundred years people have celebrated Gunpowder Treason Day, later renamed Guy Fawkes Night, on November 5, burning an effigy of him in remembrance.

In conclusion, if you would like your name to be used as a synonym of "man" in 300 years, you could do worse than trying to blow up the House of Lords, as long as you don't mind the annual burnings of you in effigy.
