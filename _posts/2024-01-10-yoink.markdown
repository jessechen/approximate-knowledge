The interjection *yoink* is probably not in even the top three words coined by The Simpsons, even though it's likely the most commonly used now. It's first heard in the 1993 episode Duffless, but quickly becomes a signature sound effect for the series. It was created by series writer George Meyer, possibly as an onomatopoeia for a rising violin sound effect that accompanied snatching something in old comedies. Series writer Bill Oakley instead claims it was taken from Jughead comics, but I wasn't able to find a searchable archive.

Truly the Shakespeare of our time.
