The word *yeet* first rose to popularity as the name of a viral dance on social short video platform Vine in February 2014. It looks like the word started getting used as a general interjection of excitement in the next two months, including two viral videos involving throwing things while yelling "yeet". The second, uploaded in April 2014 ([archived on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzuy7UxlE8)), looks to be what solidified the association with throwing.

Unusually, the word died down along with Vine itself before experiencing a resurgence (not along with Vine itself) in 2018, now more established as a verb for "throw suddenly". [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2014-01-01%202024-01-01&q=yeet)
