You, the consciousness reading this that is successfully converting millions of stimuli with slightly different intensities into symbols or sounds and then extracting meaning from them, cohabit your body with [an animal who is also you](https://www.robinhobb.com/blog/archives/2021-05). That animal is a good girl/boy/pal who wants to be helpful and tries its best but can't communicate in words with you the way I am doing here. It wants plenty of rest and sun and good food and a stimulating environment and when it feels good, you feel good, because it's you. And when it feels bad because maybe you're like young me and don't know the animal is trying to tell you it needs exercise and you get confused and angry when the animal is grumpy and destructive, you feel bad, because *the animal is also you*.
