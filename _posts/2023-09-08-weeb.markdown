The word *weeaboo* first appears as a nonsense word in a 2005 Perry Bible Fellowship webcomic: [https://pbfcomics.com/comics/weeaboo/](https://pbfcomics.com/comics/weeaboo/)

It gained its current meaning later that year. On anonymous web forum 4chan, "wapanese" was then a common slur used against white people who enjoyed anime and manga. As an intervention, moderators added a word filter that replaced all instances of it with a ridiculous word that didn't mean anything, "weeaboo". This did not dramatically reduce the frequency of its usage, but it did end up changing the word that was used.

*Weeaboo* continued to be a common enough word on the internet that a short form, *weeb*, became standard within a few more years. It has mostly lost its original pejorative sense.
