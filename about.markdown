Hi, I'm Jesse. This personal blog is themed around the [demon cat with approximate knowledge of many things](https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Cat). Besides showcasing my interactive visual art projects, it includes explorations of etymology and the history of technology.

You can find me on Github at [github.com/jessechen](http://github.com/jessechen).
