Hi, I'm Jesse. This personal blog is themed around the [demon cat with approximate knowledge of many things](https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Cat). Besides showcasing my interactive visual art projects, it includes explorations of etymology and the history of technology.

You can find me on Github at [github.com/jessechen](https://github.com/jessechen).

For content from before 2023, or just something different, I also have kept a linkblog since 2017 over at [meleemancer.tumblr.com](https://meleemancer.tumblr.com).
